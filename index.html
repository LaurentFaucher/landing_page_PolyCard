        <h2>‚ôªÔ∏è Our Mission ‚ôªÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>Every day, we use a multitude of cards in our wallets. These cards, such as credit, debit, transport, driver's license and ID cards, expire after a certain period of time and often represent a recycling dilemma, due to the confidential information they contain. We've found that many people are reluctant to throw them away or recycle them, fearing that their personal or banking data could be exposed.</p>
        <p>To address this problem, our idea is to design a recovery station that will guarantee the secure destruction of sensitive data, while enabling the recovery of materials. Indeed, these cards are generally made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic and metals such as copper or aluminum, often used in electronic chips. Our station will enable these materials to be recovered for efficient recycling, while ensuring user confidentiality. In addition to this ecological and secure solution, we are planning to set up a reward system to encourage you to use our stations.</p>
